Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in industrial settings, particularly in edge computing applications. Edge machine learning involves deploying machine learning models on edge devices, such as sensors, robots, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to process data in real-time and make decisions without the need for centralized processing. While some industrial edge machine learning use cases can be challenging, others offer low hanging fruits and can provide quick wins for companies. In this article, we will explore some of the low hanging fruits in industrial edge machine learning use cases. 

Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection is a low hanging fruit in industrial edge machine learning. Anomaly detection involves analyzing data from sensors and other devices to detect abnormal behavior, indicating equipment failure or other issues. Anomaly detection can be performed on the edge, enabling real-time alerts and preventing equipment downtime. 

Predictive Maintenance: Predictive maintenance is another low hanging fruit in industrial edge machine learning. Predictive maintenance involves analyzing data from sensors and other devices to predict when equipment will fail, enabling proactive maintenance. Predictive maintenance on the edge can provide significant benefits, including reduced maintenance costs, improved equipment reliability, and increased uptime. 

Quality Control: Quality control is another low hanging fruit in industrial edge machine learning. Quality control involves analyzing data from sensors and other devices to ensure that products meet certain quality standards. Quality control on the edge can provide real-time analysis, preventing defective products from entering the market and reducing waste. 

Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is another low hanging fruit in industrial edge machine learning. Energy efficiency involves analyzing data from sensors and other devices to optimize energy consumption, reducing costs and environmental impact. Energy efficiency on the edge can provide real-time analysis, enabling quick adjustments to energy usage. 

Inventory Management: Inventory management is another low hanging fruit in industrial edge machine learning. Inventory management involves analyzing data from sensors and other devices to optimize inventory levels, reducing costs and improving supply chain efficiency. Inventory management on the edge can provide real-time analysis, enabling quick adjustments to inventory levels. 

In conclusion, industrial edge machine learning offers several low hanging fruits that can provide quick wins for companies. Anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control, energy efficiency, and inventory management are just a few examples of low hanging fruits in industrial edge machine learning use cases. By deploying machine learning models on edge devices, companies can benefit from real-time analysis, reduced costs, improved efficiency, and increased uptime. As machine learning continues to evolve, industrial edge machine learning will play an increasingly important role in modern industry.
