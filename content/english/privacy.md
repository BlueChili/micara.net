Thank you for visiting our website. The safe handling of your data is particularly important to us. We would therefore like to inform you in detail about the use of your data when visiting our website. 

**Legal basis of processing**

Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Article 6 (S) 1 lit. b DSGVO. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which the processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. p. 1 lit. c DSGVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 para. p. 1 lit. d DSGVO. Finally, processing operations could also be based on Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. 

Right to information, right to rectification, blocking, deletion, objection 

Upon written request, we will inform you about the personal data stored by us. You also have the right to correct, block, object to or delete this data. The request should be sent to our address given in the imprint of the website: 

Micara UG 
Lohstr. 24 
81543 München 

or alternatively you can write an email to datenschutz (ät) micara.net. 

**Data sharing**

We do not transfer your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below. We will only disclose your personal data to third parties if: 

You have given your express consent to this in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a DSGVO, 

the disclosure is necessary pursuant to Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of your data, 

in the event that a legal obligation exists for the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. c DSGVO, as well as 

this is legally permissible and necessary according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b DSGVO for the processing of contractual relationships with you. 

**Data subject rights**

You have that right: 

in accordance with Art. 15 DSGVO to request information about your personal data processed by us. In particular, you can request information about the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a right of complaint, the origin of your data if it has not been collected by us, as well as the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, if applicable, meaningful information about its details; 

in accordance with Art. 16 DSGVO to immediately demand the correction of incorrect or completion of your personal data stored by us; 

pursuant to Art. 17 DSGVO to request the erasure of your personal data stored by us, unless the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; 

to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data in accordance with Art. 18 DSGVO, insofar as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you object to its erasure and we no longer require the data, but you need it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or you have objected to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 DSGVO; 

pursuant to Art. 20 DSGVO to receive your personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format or to request the transfer to another controller; 

to revoke your consent at any time in accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO. This has the consequence that we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent for the future, and 

pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence or place of work or the place of the alleged infringement for this purpose, if the data subject believes that the processing of personal data concerning him or her violates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

**Right of withdrawal**

If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data pursuant to Art. 21 DSGVO, provided that there are grounds for doing so that arise from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct marketing. In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which is implemented by us without specifying a particular situation. If you wish to exercise your right of revocation or objection, an e-mail to datenschutz (ät) micara.net is sufficient.

Use of social plugins 

Our website uses social plugins from various social networks. When you call up a web page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of the social networks. The content of the plugin is transmitted by the social networks directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the website. 

By integrating the plugins, the social networks receive the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into one or more social networks, the social networks in question can assign the visit to your account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the "Like" button or sending a tweet, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and Twitter and stored there. 

The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the social networks, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, can be found in the corresponding data protection information. 

**Links to third party websites**

On this website, references to third party websites are offered in the form of so-called links or linkings. Only when you click on such a link, data is transferred to the link destination. This is technically necessary. The transmitted data are in particular: Your IP address, the time at which you clicked on the link, the page on which you clicked on the link, information about your Internet browser. If you do not want this data to be transferred to the link destination, do not click on the link. 

**Links to other websites**

Our website/app may from time to time contain links to third party websites or to other websites of ours. If you follow a link to one of these websites, please be aware that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.

We secure our website and other IT systems through appropriate technical and organizational measures against loss, destruction, unauthorized access, unauthorized modification or unauthorized disclosure of your data.
